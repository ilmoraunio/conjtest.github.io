== Introduction

Conjtest is a command-line utility heavily inspired and partially based on
https://www.conftest.dev[conftest]. It allows you to write policies against
structured configuration data using a robust and practical language. You can,
for example, write policies against your EDN files, Kubernetes configurations,
Terraform code, or against other common configuration formats.

=== Who is this for?

This tool is suited for you if:

- You want to validate your configuration files using a Policy-as-Code tool as
  part of a CI/CD pipeline.
- Catch problems or security issues before they become incidents & enforce
  compliance.
- You want maintain the policies using Clojure/Babashka.
